For many years I have wondered “what if?”

Back in middle school I remember taking the first computer class to ever exist in my school. I remember that they were apple computers.  That was my first introduction to coding. I had to create a face of a dog and input colors.  Funny thing, I still have that creation saved on a floppy disc.  Till this day, I am still hooked to the tech world.  

Unfortunately, in high school they didn’t have any high level computer classes. They only offered a basic computer class, which was just to learn how to operate a computer.  After high school I went to to University of Texas at El Paso.  I can thank my counselor Ms. Wender,  she called me into her office and asked me if I was going to attend college. My answer was I don’t know. She said,  " You are really good in math and have taken all our advanced maths. You should be an engineer".  After looking  into engineering I was interested in electrical and also computer science.  I attended for three years until my life took a turn. 

I didn't grow up with money so attending college and working fulltime was getting financially hard.  Not knowing what to do, a friend of mine mention to me "LETS JOIN THE ARMY".  I figured we will get paid and have money for school.  So, in 1993 I enlisted in the United States Army.  For some resson I qualified for a lot of medical positions. I served as a combat medic for ten years active and reserve.  With the skills that I learned in the military I applied them to the civilian world.  I started working in the hospitals in the emergency room and later transfered to the operating room.  Twenty-five years later I am still working in the operating room and I own my own business specializing in assisting in orthropaedics.

I always ask myself, "what if?".  What if I would have continued in engineering or computer science?  For me, life took over. I got married and started a family, now it was not about me. It was about my family and supporting my family. During that time of raising a family I never looked into changing my career or going back to school.  Actually, it never crossed my mind.

Life can be very interesting. I would have never thought that we would go through a pandemic.  Unfortunately, we are in one and there is no end in site.  For me, I never would have thought that I would be out of a job or be furloughed especillay being in the medical field and people always needing our services.  Well, I was wrong since the majority of orthropaedic's problems are not emergencies.  The state stopped us from doing elective surgeries.  Which meant I will not be working.  

One morning, my wife mentioned to me about a news segment she saw on one of the morning shows about new-collar jobs.  It was all about tech jobs so it got me really interseted.  After looking into it and doing some research,  IBM was  offering a skill level test on their website. This test showed if you are good in any of the tech fields.  After two hours of testing,  my results came back showing that I was good in some of the fields of the tech fields.  There were two that caught my eye, cyber security and software engineering. I looked into software engineering and it brought me back to my middle school computer class. I realized this is what I need to do in life. With the support of my family, I began my journey in software engineering.

In concluion, my life has been great. My wife and kids are the best thing that has ever happened to me. Life takes you into different journeys.  If I would have kept going to engineering school or not join the army, my life might have be totally different.  But I will tell you one thing, I wouldn't change it.  Life is crazy, look at me now. I am changing my career twenty five years later and I'm going back to what I orginally started in college and now being enrolled in Flatiron to become a software engineer.
